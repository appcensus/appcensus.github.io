As we start on our demonstration iBeacons project, we realized that we were presented with a great opportunity to get familiar with [Parse](https://parse.com "Parse"). Parse is a great service that provides the backend infrastructure for for apps. From the Parse website:


>**Everything you need to create beautiful apps**

>Focus on creating a great user experience and forget complex infrastructure. Instantly add a powerful core, push notifications, and analytics to your app with Parse. With native SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript, Unity, and more, Parse has an SDK for everyone, whether you’re creating a desktop or mobile app.

We have used the Parse SDK in our iOS app (in Swift) and as part of a web dashboard developed in Javascript. As of right now, the [dashboard code](https://github.com/appcensus/ibeacon-dashboard "appcensus/ibeacon-dashboard · GitHub") is avaiable on [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub · Build software better, together.").
