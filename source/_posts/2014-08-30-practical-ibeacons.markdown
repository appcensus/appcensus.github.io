### iBeacons Outside of Marketing

As we start to reseach iBeacons, the possibilities for marketing are obvious. Nemerious articles document their utility for advertising.

We are interested in the use of iBeacons outside of marketing and advertising. In my mind inorder for beacons to be well accepted uses outside of marketing need to become mainstream. Some of the areas that I believe are promising include:

* The Connected Home
* Hospitals
* Schools
* Museums
* Conferences
* Hotels

The use I am most intested in is the idea of the connected home. I can see that the use of a beacon to make things happen as you arrive home is both interesting and exciting.
