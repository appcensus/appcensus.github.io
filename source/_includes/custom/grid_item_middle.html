iBeacon is the trademark for an indoor proximity system that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/ibeacon/">Apple</a> Inc. calls "a new class of low-powered, low-cost transmitters that can notify nearby iOS 7 devices of their presence." The technology enables a smart phone or other device to perform actions when in close proximity to an iBeacon. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBeacon">Wikipedia</a>
